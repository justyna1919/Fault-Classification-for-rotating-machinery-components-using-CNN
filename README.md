# Abstract 

The aim of this work is to develop, implement and validate a neural predictive maintenance algorithm for rotating device bearings. This algorithm is designed to analyze the created time-frequency spectrum based on diagnostic data and, on this basis, classify the condition of the bearing. The project will test various approaches to spectrum analysis using artificial neural networks and signal processing technologies.

The development of this algorithm aims to find the answer to the question: how can the potential of artificial intelligence and neural networks be used to diagnose and predict failures of rotating devices? How can the analysis of various types of spectra help to improve the efficiency and reliability of these devices? The development of this algorithm is aimed at answering the question: how can the potential of artificial intelligence and neural networks be used to apply and predict indicators of rotating devices? How can spectrum type analysis work for performance and these devices?

# Data

The data is collected from the Case Western Reserve University. The [website](https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter)
provides access to ball bearing test data for normal and faulty bearings.  Experiments is unique in that the actual test conditions of the motor as well as the bearing fault status have been carefully documented for each experiment.

Motor bearings were seeded with faults using electro-discharge machining (EDM). Faults ranging from 0.007 inches in diameter to 0.040 inches in diameter were introduced separately at the inner raceway, rolling element (i.e. ball) and outer raceway. Faulted bearings were reinstalled into the test motor and vibration data was recorded for motor loads of 0 to 3 horsepower (motor speeds of 1797 to 1720 RPM).

Vibration signals of 4 classes of bearings were measured in the experiment, namely:

-normal bearing without fault (N)

-bearing with single point fault at the inner raceway (IR)

-bearing with single point fault at the outer raceway (OR)

-bearing with single point fault at the ball (B).
